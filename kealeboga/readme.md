# Project Overview
Here you will write a short description of your project.
My project is a catfolio. I used a tag to indicate that declares the whold documents type, which is an HTML. The language is the root element of the document, specifying that the language is English. The meta charset declares the character set of the document and it's a UTF-8. H1 and H2 are the only headings used throughout the whole document. Paragraph tag has been used together with the bold tag on the about me section. The table is in the portfolio section and there are rows and cells together with data in the cells too. I created a button under the contract section which is the submit button. In the footer a copyright notice is added.
